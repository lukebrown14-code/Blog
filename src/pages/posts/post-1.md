Absurdism is a philosophy in which life derives no inherit meaning. We are just on this earth for no real reason. The "absurd" comes from the tension where human have a desire to find meaning in this world but there is nothing but chaos and a lack of purposes.

Albert Camus was one of the main developer of this idea. He argues that instead of the despair of realising there is no meaning in life, we should embrace the freedom it gives us. It shouldn't lead us down a path of Nihilism. He claims there are three response to absurdism:

1. **Suicide**: to escape the conflict
2. **Leap of Faith**: finding meaning in faith or an idea
3. **Acceptance**: live life expecting the absurd

In summary Camus idea is about facing life's chaos, struggle and difficulty with courage. Rejecting the path of less resistance. He writes famously, "One must imagine Sisyphus happy". Here he is saying happiness in life comes from the hardship and struggle that life throws at you. He makes call to live a life fully even though nothing matter and universe doesn't care
